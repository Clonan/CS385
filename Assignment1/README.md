I like how this is able to make a moving non-euclidean object that doesn't look super weird. 
While most of these WebGL objects don't seem super practical, they can be used to add design to websites.

I also thought it was interesting that sound could be produced using WebGL.
This again doesn't look like it would be usable for something very practical however.
